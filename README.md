The UAT Space program demands the best practices in code for efficiency so you are tasked to make improvements to the code. 

This means you will need to add a loop instead of repeating the code. 
(Use Mission Control We have BlastOff, for reference for the assignment) then implement the loop.

Also, add a conditional (if statement) that if the countdown is less than 25 seconds, a message should read “Warning Less than ½ way to launch, time left = insert variable here”
